  ## Description 
  
  This project is a backend API designed to be a base framework for which a social media platofmr could be created. The base types of objects are Users and Thoughts, where a User has many Thoughts, as well as many friends, who are also Users. Thoughts also have many reactions, which are subdocuments not given a full model, only a schema. This project uses NoSQL provider MongoDB as well as js package Mongoose to connect to it, and express.js to facilitate connections from outside the app and routing of traffic.
